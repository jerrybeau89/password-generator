# Password-Generator
This repo will hold an app that will allow a user to generate a random password based on user criteria input.

## Description

Creating a password can be simple, sometimes too easy and guessable. The more characters and character variations used, the harder it would be to guess someone's password. I created this project to provide a simple way for employees to generate strong random passwords using preselected criteria. The user will be able to select Lowercase, Uppercase, Numbers, and/or Special characters to use in their password creation. In using this app it ensures the password generated is highly unique and stronger than a standard password one may be inclined to create. In creating this project, I learned how to concat strings, as well as, strengthened my experience with do/while loops and functions.
